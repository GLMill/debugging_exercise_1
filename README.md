# Debugging practice

Time limit: 60 minutes

You can use this exercise to practice and assess your debugging skill.

If you submit a solution to this exercise, Makers Academy will be able to use it to assess your debugging skill, and also offer you guidance on how to improve.

## Instructions

The goal is to get all the tests in the `spec/` directory passing.

1. Fork this repo.

2. Clone your fork to your machine.

2. Run the tests by running `rspec` in the root of the repo.

3. Get all the tests in `spec/` passing within the time limit (at the top of this file).

4. To help you debug, feel free to add more tests.

5. To check that your debugged code will be assessed as correct by Travis, run `rake verify`.  This runs a clean version of the tests.  If all these tests pass, you've successfully debugged the repo.

6. Make a pull request to this repo to submit your solution to the exercise.

## Things to watch out for

* Don't change the files in the `.spec_verify/` directory.
